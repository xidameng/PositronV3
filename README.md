Upside-down, compact, portable, and super fast 3D printer - `Positron V3` has it all. A compact 3D printer that packs into a filament spool box, so you can take it anywhere you want. This design is looking at a 3D printer less like a stationary machine, but more like a powerful tool in a maker/inventor's tool kit. The printer deploys and folds up in less than 90 seconds, fits easily inside a bag, and prints at 200+mm/s.

**Specs**: 
- Max Print Speed: `250mm/s`
- Max Travel Speed: `350mm/s`
- Acceleration: `9800mm/s^2`
- Build Volume: `180x185x180mm`
- Weight: `2700-3100g`
- Hotend max temp: `250C`
